#### 10. From black hole thermodynamics to black hole chemistry - Jiayue Yang (杨佳悦)

**Abstract:** Over the past five decades, noteworthy progress has been made in black hole thermodynamics. With thermodynamic pressure and volume properly defined, the thermodynamic phase space can be extended. In this theoretical framework of black hole chemistry, a variety of rich thermodynamic and chemical phenomena, such as black hole phase transitions, triple points, and Van der Waals-like behaviour have been discovered. Here we carry out the first investigation of the dynamics of the recently discovered multicriticality in black holes. We specifically consider black hole quadruple points in D = 4 Einstein gravity coupled to non-linear electrodynamics. We observe thermodynamic phase transitions between the four stable phases at the quadruple point by numerically solving the Smoluchowski equation.

#### 11. Holomorphic quasi-modular bootstrap, defects and mirror symmetry - Yiwen Pan (潘逸文)

**Abstract:** Classifying conformal field theory is an interesting topic in both theoretical physics and mathematics. In this talk we will discuss a particular approach to classifying 2d chiral symmetry algebra of 2d CFTs, referred to as the holomorphic (quasi)-modular bootstrap. Such an approach has intriguing connection to 4d $\mathcal{N} = 2$ superconformal field theories, non-local operators and geometry of Hitchin system moduli space.

**Biography:** Yiwen Pan received his Bachelor degree from Sun Yat-sen University, and later the doctoral degree in physics from Stony Brook University. He worked as a postdoc in Uppsala University in Sweden, and later joined the School of Physics at Sun Yat-sen University. His research interests center around supersymmetric field theory, exactly computable observables and dualities, conformal field theory and chiral algebra, and related topics in mathematical physics.

#### 12. AdS/CFT correspondent from the point of view of Stress Tensor and Conservation Current - Qiongyu Qi (祁琼宇)

**Abstract:** In this lecture, I will focus on AdS Gravity from the point of view of Stress Tensor and other conservation current. I will revisit the basic facts about the quasilocal stress tensor and the asymptotic symmetry in gravitational systems. Then I will discuss the correspond between Long-Range Force and CFT currents. Finally I will propose a procedure for computing the boundary stress tensor associated with a gravitating system in asymptotically AdS space (AdS<sub>3</sub> and AdS<sub>5</sub>). Via the AdS/CFT correspondence, the result is interpretable as the expectation value of the stress tensor in a quantum conformal field theory. The two dimensional stress tensor transforms with a Schwarzian derivative and the expected central charge. We also find a nonzero ground state energy for global AdS<sub>5</sub>, and show that it exactly matches the Casimir energy of the dual N=4 super Yang-Mills theory on S3×R.

**Biography:** TBA

#### 13. Holographic correlators from analytic bootstrap - Xinan Zhou (周稀楠)

**Abstract:** Holographic correlators are basic observables for exploring and exploiting the AdS/CFT correspondence. However, computing them using traditional methods is notoriously difficult. In this talk, I will give a general introduction to a modern program of holographic correlators where these difficulties are circumvented by using analytic conformal bootstrap techniques. I will review some of the important progress and outline a number of future directions.

**Biography:** Prof. Xinan Zhou did his undergraduate studies at University of Science and Technology of China, and obtained his PhD from the C. N. Yang Institute for Theoretical Physics at Stony Brook University in 2018. From 2018 to 2021, he was a postdoc fellow at the Princeton Center for Theoretical Science in Princeton University. He joined the Kavli Institute for Theoretical Sciences in University of Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2021 and has also been a visiting Assistant Professor at ShanghaiTech University since 2023. Prof. Zhou has published more than 30 papers with over 2000 citations. He has made original contributions to the computation of conformal correlators in the context of AdS/CFT and the development of new analytic tools for studying conformal field theories. He was awarded the 2023 ICTP Prize for these contributions.

#### 14. Noether's Theorem and AdS<sub>3</sub> Gravity - Zhe Feng (冯哲)

**Abstract:** In this work, we revisit the approach with the covariant phase space formalism for the asymptotic symmetry analysis in the pure AdS<sub>3</sub> gravity. We modify the approach to a version which is exactly in the framework of Noether's theorem. The key point in the modification is to take a systematical treatment of the boundary effects.

In particular, we start from defining the pure AdS<sub>3</sub> gravity in Lagrangian formalism, where we adopt proper asymptotic boundary conditions, and we take holographic renormalization in the off-shell level. We then follow Noether's theorem step by step with a careful treatment of the boundary terms.

Following our modified approach, we get the following two results. First, we show that the asymptotic symmetries are indeed symmetries of the pure AdS<sub>3</sub> gravity in the sense of Noether's theorem. Second, we compute the associated charges of the asymptotic symmetries with the expression of Noether charge, which reproduces the same result from the ordinarily used approach with the covariant phase space formalism.

**Biography:** Zhe Feng is a Master's student under the supervision of Prof. Jie-qiang Wu at the Institute of Theoretical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences. He obtained his B.Sc. in Physics from Hohai University in 2024. His research focuses on the AdS/CFT correspondence and quantum gravity.

#### 15. A Brief Introduction to Quantum Geometry - Renjie Tong (佟仁杰)

**Abstract:** In this lecture, we will frist introduce the general setting of quantum geometry in order to reveal that the imaginary part of quantum geometry tensor is excatly the Berry curvature. Then we will review the basic concepts such as the Berry phase and the Berry curvature. Finally, we will show the implication of quantum geometry both in semiclassical wave packet dynamics and the Perturbation theories based on the ac Hall effect.

**Biography:** TBA

#### 16. Quantum Metrology with Many-Body States - Hu Zhiyao (胡知遥)

**Abstract:** Quantum metrology aims to leverage quantum mechanical effects to improve the performance of parameter estimation with the limited resources, while many-body entanglement is usually introduced to assist in this process. However, how to generate desired many-body states, how to make better use of many-body states in sensing are open questions in this area. In this talk, I will present our latest works on improving precision with quadratic collective-spin interaction, improving precision and robustness using non-gaussian states, as well as rapidly generating GHZ(-like) states.

**Biography:** Cheng Peng graduated from the Yuanpei College of Peking University and got his Ph.D. degree from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor under the supervision of Prof. Henriette Elvang. He then worked at ETH Zurich, Brown University, and UC Davis. He joined the Kavli Institute for Theoretical Sciences (KITS) at the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS) in September 2020. His research interest lies in the intersection of quantum field theory, gravity, and string theory. Recently, he has been focusing on higher-spin theories and ensemble average theories.

#### 18. Can GPT Speak the Quantum Language? - Jian Yao (姚健)

**Abstract:** In this talk, I will briefly introduce our work of ShadowGPT, a novel approach for solving quantum many-body problems by learning from randomized measurement data collected from quantum experiments. The model is a generative pretrained transformer (GPT) trained on simulated classical shadow data of ground states of quantum Hamiltonians, obtained through randomized Pauli measurements. Once trained, the model can predict a range of ground state properties across the Hamiltonian parameter space. We demonstrate its effectiveness on the transverse-field Ising model and the  cluster-Ising model, accurately predicting ground state energy, correlation functions, and entanglement entropy. This approach highlights the potential of combining quantum data with classical machine learning to address complex quantum many-body challenges.

#### 19. Conservation Charge in Curved Space-time: From Static Space-time to Asymptotic Symmetry - Yunke Zhao (赵云柯)

**Abstract:** TBA

**Biography:** TBA

#### 20. An Introduction to Blackhole Thermodynamics - Junkai Wang (王俊凯)

**Abstract:** Why is falling into a black hole a one-way journey?  How can this be reconciled with our knowledge about quantum theory which is intrinsically reversible?  Is information truly lost along with the infalling observer? Does a white hole exist? Those are general questions about blackhole physics but can be strictly considered and rigorously modeled. 

Theoretical physics community in the past half century has witnessed remarkable progress in understanding the quantum nature of black holes, inspired by advances in supersymmetry, holographic duality, string theory, quantum information and other fields. Recent work has demonstrated a promising picture that there's possibility to understand realistic black hole as a quantum gravity system. The quantum physics of black holes naturally reconciles general relativity and statistical mechanics,  describing as a "thermodynamic theory" at a semiclassical level. 

The audience should have foundational knowledge of quantum physics and statistical mechanics as a prerequisite. As some further explorations, readers may find it helpful to consult arXiv:2006.06872, arXiv:2201.03096, and arXiv:2410.14414 (also famous lecture series taught by Hartman, Hong Liu, Susskind, ....).  Our main reference will be arxiv:2412.16795 "Introduction to Black Hole Thermodynamics" recently released by the prominent theorical physicist Prof. Edward Witten.

#### 2. A general introduction to intersection homology - Zhou Fang (方舟)

**Abstract:** In recent years, intersection homology has become an indispensable tool for studying the topology of singular spaces. While the main results of usual homology theories often fail for singular spaces, intersection homology effectively recovers these properties, bridging this critical gap. In this talk, I will present the foundational concepts of GM intersection homology (including simplicial intersection homology, PL intersection homology, and singular intersection homology) and some examples. Finally, I may explore the topic of non-GM (Goresky-MacPherson) intersection homology.

#### 3. Explicit examples of Higgs bundles in the contexts of quantum materials and geometric Langlands correspondence - Yifei Zhu (朱一飞)

**Abstract:** We discuss the topology, geometry, and physics of explicit examples of rank-2 and rank-3 Higgs bundles, as eigenbundles associated to gapless quantum mechanical systems.  In particular, we explain why hyperbolic band theory (after A.J. Kollár et al.) and such gapless non-Hermitian systems are natural from the mathematical viewpoint of Higgs bundles.  Moreover, afforded by such systems, we explain how the physical bulk–edge correspondence may have a mathematical origin of the Langlands correspondence, as evidenced by the respective roles played by Higgs bundles.

#### 4. An introduction to p-adic hodge theory - Shenguanlin Lin (林沈冠霖)
