#### 1. Noether's Theorem and AdS<sub>3</sub> Gravity - Zhe Feng (冯哲)

**Abstract:** In this work, we revisit the approach with the covariant phase space formalism for the asymptotic symmetry analysis in the pure AdS<sub>3</sub> gravity. We modify the approach to a version which is exactly in the framework of Noether's theorem. The key point in the modification is to take a systematical treatment of the boundary effects.

**Biography:** Zhe Feng is a Master's student under the supervision of Prof. Jie-qiang Wu at the Institute of Theoretical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences. He obtained his B.Sc. in Physics from Hohai University in 2024. His research focuses on the AdS/CFT correspondence and quantum gravity.

#### 2. Quantum Metrology with Many-Body States – Hu Zhiyao (胡知遥)

**Abstract:** Quantum metrology aims to leverage quantum mechanical effects to improve the performance of parameter estimation with the limited resources, while many-body entanglement is usually introduced to assist in this process. However, how to generate desired many-body states, how to make better use of many-body states in sensing are open questions in this area. In this talk, I will present our latest works on improving precision with quadratic collective-spin interaction, improving precision and robustness using non-gaussian states, as well as rapidly generating GHZ(-like) states.

Ref: Phys. Rev. A.108.023722, Phys. Rev. Letters 132, 113402 (2024), Chinese Phys. B 33 080601

**Biography:** Mr. Zhiyao Hu is currently a first year PhD student in the Pritzker School of Molecular Engineering at the University of Chicago. He earned his Bachelor of Science in Physics from Xi’an Jiaotong University in 2024. During his sophomore year, he began his undergraduate research in quantum optics under the guidance of Prof. Fu-li Li at XJTU. He then furthered his research experience by joining Prof. Yong-Chun Liu’s group at Tsinghua University as a research intern, where he focused on spin squeezing and quantum metrology. In his junior year, he was invited to MIT as a visiting undergraduate scholar in Prof. Paola Cappellaro’s group, and later, he served as a junior research associate in Prof. Haidong Yuan’s group at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, where his work centered on quantum control and multiparameter estimation. His research interests are at the intersection of atomic, molecular, and optical (AMO) physics and quantum information science.

#### 3. Differentiable & Symbolic Modeling of the Universe in the era of Machine Learning - Yin Li (李寅)

**Abstract:** Rapid advances in machine learning have brought not only myriad powerful neural network models, but also breakthroughs that can potentially benefit established scientific research. This talk focuses on two such applications in cosmology.

The first one aims at optimal inference of physical information from cosmological surveys, by differentiable forward modeling of the Universe. Using the adjoint method, we've developed a memory and computation efficient differentiable simulation framework on GPUs, upon which we are adding various cosmological probes. One most important probe is gravitational lensing, for which we have developed a novel Hamiltonian, post-Born, three-dimensional, on-the-fly ray tracing algorithm. The end goal is a field-level forward model of all probes of the whole observable Universe, with which we can jointly infer physics of interest and/or the initial conditions of the Universe, while marginalizing over others.

In the other application, we symbolically model cosmic reionization to simplify the standard ΛCDM cosmology, from a 6-parameter model to a 5-parameter one. Using symbolic regression, we distill analytic expressions from numerical simulations and discover that the Gompertz function, discovered 200 years ago to model human mortality, also well describes the mortality of neutral hydrogen in the Universe. This simulation-based symbolic approach is key to multiple important cosmological and astrophysical results that I will present.

**Biography:** Yin Li is a research scientist at the Peng Cheng Laboratory in Shenzhen, China, working at the interface between machine learning, statistics, cosmology and astrophysics. Previously, he was a Flatiron Research Fellow with a joint appointment at the Center for Computational Astrophysics (CCA) and the Center for Computational Mathematics (CCM) in the Simons Foundation. Before that, he was a joint postdoctoral cosmologist at the Berkeley Center for Cosmological Physics (BCCP), University of California, Berkeley, and the Kavli Institute for the Physics and Mathematics of the Universe (IPMU), University of Tokyo. He did his Ph.D. and B.S. in physics, respectively at the University of Chicago and Peking University.

#### 4. From black hole thermodynamics to black hole chemistry - Jiayue Yang (杨佳悦)

**Abstract:** Over the past five decades, noteworthy progress has been made in black hole thermodynamics. With thermodynamic pressure and volume properly defined, the thermodynamic phase space can be extended. In this theoretical framework of black hole chemistry, a variety of rich thermodynamic and chemical phenomena, such as black hole phase transitions, triple points, and Van der Waals-like behaviour have been discovered. Here we carry out the first investigation of the dynamics of the recently discovered multicriticality in black holes. We specifically consider black hole quadruple points in D = 4 Einstein gravity coupled to non-linear electrodynamics. We observe thermodynamic phase transitions between the four stable phases at the quadruple point by numerically solving the Smoluchowski equation.

**Biography:** YANG Jiayue is currently a PhD student in Applied Math at the University of Waterloo, Canada. She graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Physics from the Tang Aoqing Honors Program at Jilin University, China, receiving the Dean's Scholarship. She completed her Master's in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Waterloo. Her research interests include high-energy physics and gravitational physics, with a focus on black hole thermodynamics, quantum information, and holography. She is also passionate about teaching and science outreach, with over 12,000 followers on her Bilibili channel.

#### 5. Can GPT Speak the Quantum Language? - Jian Yao (姚健)

**Abstract:** In this talk, I will briefly introduce our work of ShadowGPT, a novel approach for solving quantum many-body problems by learning from randomized measurement data collected from quantum experiments. The model is a generative pretrained transformer (GPT) trained on simulated classical shadow data of ground states of quantum Hamiltonians, obtained through randomized Pauli measurements. Once trained, the model can predict a range of ground state properties across the Hamiltonian parameter space. We demonstrate its effectiveness on the transverse-field Ising model and the  cluster-Ising model, accurately predicting ground state energy, correlation functions, and entanglement entropy. This approach highlights the potential of combining quantum data with classical machine learning to address complex quantum many-body challenges.

#### 6. A short introduction to effective field theory of topological orders in higher dimensions – Ye Peng (叶鹏)

**Abstract:** In 3+1D and higher dimensions, spatially nonlocal objects such as loops and membranes are topological excitations of topologically ordered phases, exhibiting emergent phenomena that do not exist in 2+1D. In this talk, I will show how to study topological orders in 3+1 and higher via effective field theory which is in general topological field theory of some kinds. If time permitted, the talk will cover the following topics:

1. field theory construction
2. braiding
3. fusion
4. quantum dimension
5. shrinking
6. pentagon equations, shrinking-fusion hexagon equations and diagrammatic representation.

In August 2018, he began to work at Sun Yat-sen University as a professor and lead a research team focusing on quantum many-body theory and cutting edge frontier of exotic phases of matter via quantum-information-perspectives.

#### 7. Holographic correlators from analytic bootstrap - Xinan Zhou (周稀楠)

**Abstract:** Holographic correlators are basic observables for exploring and exploiting the AdS/CFT correspondence. However, computing them using traditional methods is notoriously difficult. In this talk, I will give a general introduction to a modern program of holographic correlators where these difficulties are circumvented by using analytic conformal bootstrap techniques. I will review some of the important progress and outline a number of future directions.

**Biography:** Prof. Xinan Zhou did his undergraduate studies at University of Science and Technology of China, and obtained his PhD from the C. N. Yang Institute for Theoretical Physics at Stony Brook University in 2018. From 2018 to 2021, he was a postdoc fellow at the Princeton Center for Theoretical Science in Princeton University. He joined the Kavli Institute for Theoretical Sciences in University of Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2021 and has also been a visiting Assistant Professor at ShanghaiTech University since 2023. Prof. Zhou has published more than 30 papers with over 2000 citations. He has made original contributions to the computation of conformal correlators in the context of AdS/CFT and the development of new analytic tools for studying conformal field theories. He was awarded the 2023 ICTP Prize for these contributions.
