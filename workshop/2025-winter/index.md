In this talk we will discuss a particular approach to classifying 2d chiral symmetry algebra of 2d CFTs, referred to as the holomorphic (quasi)-modular bootstrap.

#### 12. AdS/CFT correspondent from the point of view of Stress Tensor and Conservation Current - Qiongyu Qi (祁琼宇)

**Abstract:** In this lecture, I will focus on AdS Gravity from the point of view of Stress Tensor and other conservation current. I will revisit the basic facts about the quasilocal stress tensor and the asymptotic symmetry in gravitational systems. Then I will discuss the correspond between Long-Range Force and CFT currents. Finally I will propose a procedure for computing the boundary stress tensor associated with a gravitating system in asymptotically AdS space (AdS<sub>3</sub> and AdS<sub>5</sub>). Via the AdS/CFT correspondence, the result is interpretable as the expectation value of the stress tensor in a quantum conformal field theory. The two dimensional stress tensor transforms with a Schwarzian derivative and the expected central charge. We also find a nonzero ground state energy for global AdS<sub>5</sub>, and show that it exactly matches the Casimir energy of the dual N=4 super Yang-Mills theory on S3×R.

I will review some of the important progress and outline a number of future directions.

He has made original contributions to the computation of conformal correlators in the context of AdS/CFT and the development of new analytic tools for studying conformal field theories. He was awarded the 2023 ICTP Prize for these contributions.

#### 14. Noether's Theorem and AdS<sub>3</sub> Gravity - Zhe Feng (冯哲)

**Abstract:** In this work, we revisit the approach with the covariant phase space formalism for the asymptotic symmetry analysis in the pure AdS<sub>3</sub> gravity. We modify the approach to a version which is exactly in the framework of Noether's theorem. The key point in the modification is to take a systematical treatment of the boundary effects.

In particular, we start from defining the pure AdS<sub>3</sub> gravity in Lagrangian formalism, where we adopt proper asymptotic boundary conditions, and we take holographic renormalization in the off-shell level. We then follow Noether's theorem step by step with a careful treatment of the boundary terms.

Following our modified approach, we get the following two results. First, we show that the asymptotic symmetries are indeed symmetries of the pure AdS<sub>3</sub> gravity in the sense of Noether's theorem. Second, we compute the associated charges of the asymptotic symmetries with the expression of Noether charge, which reproduces the same result from the ordinarily used approach with the covariant phase space formalism.

**Biography:** Zhe Feng is a Master's student under the supervision of Prof. Jie-qiang Wu at the Institute of Theoretical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences. He obtained his B.Sc. in Physics from Hohai University in 2024. His research focuses on the AdS/CFT correspondence and quantum gravity.

Finally, we will show the implication of quantum geometry both in semiclassical wave packet dynamics and the Perturbation theories based on the ac Hall effect.

**Biography:** Renjie Tong is a first-year undergraduate student at SUSTech.

#### 16. Quantum Metrology with Many-Body States - Hu Zhiyao (胡知遥)

**Abstract:** Quantum metrology aims to leverage quantum mechanical effects to improve the performance of parameter estimation with the limited resources, while many-body entanglement is usually introduced to assist in this process. However, how to generate desired many-body states, how to make better use of many-body states in sensing are open questions in this area. In this talk, I will present our latest works on improving precision with quadratic collective-spin interaction, improving precision and robustness using non-gaussian states, as well as rapidly generating GHZ(-like) states.

#### 18. Can GPT Speak the Quantum Language? - Jian Yao (姚健)

**Abstract:** In this talk, I will briefly introduce our work of ShadowGPT, a novel approach for solving quantum many-body problems by learning from randomized measurement data collected from quantum experiments. The model is a generative pretrained transformer (GPT) trained on simulated classical shadow data of ground states of quantum Hamiltonians, obtained through randomized Pauli measurements. Once trained, the model can predict a range of ground state properties across the Hamiltonian parameter space. We demonstrate its effectiveness on the transverse-field Ising model and the  cluster-Ising model, accurately predicting ground state energy, correlation functions, and entanglement entropy. This approach highlights the potential of combining quantum data with classical machine learning to address complex quantum many-body challenges.

#### 19. Conservation Charge in Curved Space-time: From Static Space-time to Asymptotic Symmetry - Yunke Zhao (赵云柯)

**Abstract:** Defining the conserved charge in general relativity is a subtle issue, often referred to as the mass problem in GR. This longstanding challenge has been a topic of discussion since the inception of general relativity and continues to present many mysteries today. It has wide-ranging applications and serves as a source of inspiration for contemporary theoretical research, including areas such as black hole physics and the holographic duality of gravity.

In this talk, we will start with static space-time, where the gravitational field does not evolve over time. In such a framework, the conservation of energy must be considered separately for matter fields and the gravitational field. We will introduce the conservation charge for matter fields in static space-time, as well as the concept of Komar mass. Following this, I will discuss various attempts to define mass in general relativity for space-times that asymptotically approach Minkowski space, including the well-known ADM mass. Finally, I will explore the connection between ADM mass and asymptotic symmetry.

**Biography:** ZHAO Yunke is a third-year undergraduate student in the Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech).

He is also interested in the mass problems in GR and Quantum approach to gravitational singularity problems.

#### 20. An Introduction to Blackhole Thermodynamics - Junkai Wang (王俊凯)

**Abstract:** Why is falling into a black hole a one-way journey?  How can this be reconciled with our knowledge about quantum theory which is intrinsically reversible?  Is information truly lost along with the infalling observer? Does a white hole exist? Those are general questions about blackhole physics but can be strictly considered and rigorously modeled. 

Theoretical physics community in the past half century has witnessed remarkable progress in understanding the quantum nature of black holes, inspired by advances in supersymmetry, holographic duality, string theory, quantum information and other fields. Recent work has demonstrated a promising picture that there's possibility to understand realistic black hole as a quantum gravity system. The quantum physics of black holes naturally reconciles general relativity and statistical mechanics,  describing as a "thermodynamic theory" at a semiclassical level. 

The audience should have foundational knowledge of quantum physics and statistical mechanics as a prerequisite. As some further explorations, readers may find it helpful to consult arXiv:2006.06872, arXiv:2201.03096, and arXiv:2410.14414 (also famous lecture series taught by Hartman, Hong Liu, Susskind, ....).  Our main reference will be arxiv:2412.16795 "Introduction to Black Hole Thermodynamics" recently released by the prominent theorical physicist Prof. Edward Witten.

#### 21. Dictionaries in gauge/gravity duality - Hai Lin (林海)

**Abstract:** Gauge/gravity duality is a nontrivial duality between quantum theory with gravity in higher dimensions and quantum system in lower dimensions. Examples include specific variant of Yang-Mills theory in 3+1d, which is a cousin of quantum chromodynamics in 3+1d, and its gravity dual. The method is instrumental for computing quantum gravity, and for computing QFTs and quantum systems from the dual side. I will talk about dictionaries in the gauge/gravity duality, involving heavy states among other aspects. The coherent state constructions can be utilized to describe heavy states. The determinant operators can be used to describe giant gravitons. Some explicit finite N quantities can be computed by giant gravitons, e.g. partition functions, indices, correlators, including line defect correlators. Formalisms of giant graviton expansion are analyzed. An incomplete list of relevant historical references could be accessed in: e.g. arXiv:2405.14564, 2212.14002, 2203.15820, 2206.06524, 2312.16751, 1702.03011, 1705.10776, 2402.19452, and references therein.

Hai Lin works in high energy theory, gauge/gravity duality, quantum field theory, quantum gravity, mathematical aspects of quantum theory, and areas in mathematical physics.

#### 22. Scattering Amplitude Method in Post-Minkowskian Expansion - Hongbo Lin (林宏博)

**Abstract:** In this talk, I will breifly introduce two promising methods initially developed to calculate gravitational wave form of binary mergers: Wordline EFT and KMOC Formalism. Nevertheless, they show growing calculation potential in more general setups. In particular, the latter formalism, related to In-In formalism of scattering amplitudes and path integral, is recently found to be naturally consistent with Post-Minkowskian expansion and is able to efficiently extract classical contribution from quantum scattering amplitudes.

**Biography:** LIN Hongbo is a third-year undergraduate student in Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech). He researches in classical gravity under the guidance of Prof. Sebastian Garcia-Saenz at SUSTech.

### Topics

#### 1. The probability threshold phenomenon of a randomly generated graph containing a specific structure - Zijie Wen (文子杰)

**Abstract:** 我们将会介绍 Erdős-Rényi 随机图模型 (G(n,p))，其中 n 为顶点数，p 为每条边存在的概率。出人意料的是，当概率在连续变化的时候，许多图属性（如连通性、包含三角形等）在 G(n,p) 中会表现出阈值现象，即当 p 达到某个临界值时，该属性会突然出现或消失。 

本讲座将围绕 Bollobás-Thomason 定理和 Kahn-Kalai 猜想展开，并说明这些现象变化的规律。

#### 2. A general introduction to intersection homology - Zhou Fang (方舟)

**Abstract:** In recent years, intersection homology has become an indispensable tool for studying the topology of singular spaces. While the main results of usual homology theories often fail for singular spaces, intersection homology effectively recovers these properties, bridging this critical gap. In this talk, I will present the foundational concepts of GM intersection homology (including simplicial intersection homology, PL intersection homology, and singular intersection homology) and some examples. Finally, I may explore the topic of non-GM (Goresky-MacPherson) intersection homology.

#### 3. Explicit examples of Higgs bundles in the contexts of quantum materials and geometric Langlands correspondence - Yifei Zhu (朱一飞)

**Abstract:** We discuss the topology, geometry, and physics of explicit examples of rank-2 and rank-3 Higgs bundles, as eigenbundles associated to gapless quantum mechanical systems.  In particular, we explain why hyperbolic band theory (after A.J. Kollár et al.) and such gapless non-Hermitian systems are natural from the mathematical viewpoint of Higgs bundles.  Moreover, afforded by such systems, we explain how the physical bulk–edge correspondence may have a mathematical origin of the Langlands correspondence, as evidenced by the respective roles played by Higgs bundles.

#### 4. An introduction to p-adic hodge theory - Shenguanlin Lin (林沈冠霖)

**Abstract:** In this talk, I will provide an introduction to p-adic Hodge theory. Specifically, I will give an overview of p-adic representation theory, focusing on the theory of (phi, Gamma)-modules and Sen's theory. Additionally, we will discuss certain p-adic representations that arise from geometry. We will explore how the theory of periods rings is used to classify these representations.

#### 5. 二次型的算术 - Yong Hu (胡勇)

**Abstract:** 本报告介绍我所了解的有关二次型算术的一部分研究课题和进展。

#### 6. TBA - Yuyang Zhang (张雨洋)

**Abstract:** TBA
